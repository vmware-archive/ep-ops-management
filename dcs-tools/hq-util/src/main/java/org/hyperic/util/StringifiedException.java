/**
 * This class captures information about an exception and stores it in a String-based form. This makes it easy to
 * transport arbitrary types of exceptions over SOAP. For example, in CAM's autoinventory scan, when a scan completes,
 * the scan state that is sent to the server could contain a instance of an exception class representing an error that
 * occurred during the scan. Instead of relying on Axis to know how to serialize/deserialize every conceivable exception
 * class, we just wrap the exceptions in this class, which makes everything string-based and easy to work with.
